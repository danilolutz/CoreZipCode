## Overview

Normaly we must implement ZipCode or Postcode services every time in each new software we create. Well this package is for keep you [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and eliminate the necessity to implement ZipCode or Postcode services over and over.

Also this package could be used for easily implements address services to yours [Microsoft .Net Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) based software.

And the **CoreZipCode** was designed to be easily extensible, and if you want, implement your own address services, you only must override the API calls methods.

We follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org), so check the package compatibility before use it.

## :sunglasses: Get Started

Well, you can download the code and build it by yourself or you can install by [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org) package in: [CoreZipCode Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CoreZipCode/).

Just in case if you doesn't want leave GitHub at this moment:

```bash
dotnet add package CoreZipCode
```

After you decide how you'll get the CoreZipCode, just inject (e.g.: [Simple Injector](https://simpleinjector.org/)) and use it.

```CSharp
using CoreZipCode.Interfaces;

namespace YourProject
{
    public YourClass
    {
        private readonly ZipCodeBaseService _coreZipCode;

        public YourClass(ZipCodeBaseService coreZipCode)
        {
            _coreZipCode = coreZipCode;
        }

        public void YourMethod()
        {
            var addressByZipCode = _coreZipCode.Execute("14810100");
            var zipCodeByAddress = _coreZipCode.Execute("sp", "araraquara", "bar達o do rio");

            // Generic type return was added in version 1.1.0
            var addressByZipCodeObject = _coreZipCode.GetAddress<ViaCepAddress>("14810100");
            var zipCodeByAddressObjectList = _coreZipCode.ListAddresses<ViaCepAddress>("sp", "araraquara", "bar達o do rio");
        }

        // Async methods introduced in 1.1.0
        public async void YourMethodAsync()
        {
            var addressByZipCode = await _coreZipCode.ExecuteAsync("14810100");
            var zipCodeByAddress = await _coreZipCode.ExecuteAsync("sp", "araraquara", "bar達o do rio");

            // Generic type return.
            var addressByZipCodeObject = await _coreZipCode.GetAddressAsync<ViaCepAddress>("14810100");
            var zipCodeByAddressObjectList = await _coreZipCode.ListAddressesAsync<ViaCepAddress>("sp", "araraquara", "bar達o do rio");
        }
    }
}
```

The `ViaCepAddress` POCO class is the type for returned JSON from [ViaCep](https://viacep.com.br) brazilian service. So you will must to implement the POCO class for your new service.

### Extending CoreZipCode

Also you can extends `ZipCodeBaseService` abstract class and create your own implementation of your prefered address service. Like below:

```CSharp
using CoreZipCode.Interfaces;

namespace CoreZipCode.Services.YourService
{
    public class YourService : ZipCodeBaseService
    {
        public override string SetZipCodeUrl(string zipcode)
        {
            // You can implement some validation method here.
            return $"https://yourservice.com/{zipcode}/json/";
        }

        public override string SetZipCodeUrlBy(string state, string city, string street)
        {
            // You can implement some validation method here.
            return $"https://yourservice.com/{state}/{city}/{street}/json/";
        }
    }
}
```

> **NOTE**: Same principles are used to extends postcode lookups (`PostCodeBaseService`).
